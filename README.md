Awesome Job on Milestone1. Your audience purpose and goal are clear and obtainable. You did a great job on defining Your persona. Your persona seemed like a real person. I was able to quickly tell what they were hoping to accomplish using your site. The frustrations/needs illustrated how technology could make her work life easier. The user story was unfortunately incorrect. Instead of focusing on Michelle's overarching goals narrow your thinking to focus more on what Michelle is hoping to accomplish by using your PWP. For example: "As a prospective client, I want to quickly tell if this applicant can meet my social media marketing needs."

	I love the idea for your PWP and think its awesome that you are creating a website for such an established Brand. From what you laid out in the wireframes/content strategy you have a clear vision of how you want the site to look like and behave.  That will end up being a huge benefit when you begin to develop your PWP. I do want to point out a few areas that might prove difficult when you start development. 
	First, how do you plan to add the videos already created by rainbow snow into the site and if you use youtube how you plan on showcasing the videos you want to be played in the about us section.
	 Second, it is not clear how you want to display the flavors available. Furthermore, what you laid out in the content strategy does not line up with what you have in the wireframes. This ambiguity can make development a lot harder.  I recommend spending more time laying out how you can best utilize the shaved ice section. 
	Lastly, How do you plan on keeping the future events section up to date? There is no easy answer to this question. It is something that affects bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu. If you look at upcoming events on the site, it hasnâ€™t been updated in over a year. Your best option may be a third party plugin that grabs events for another place. That said most plugins would fall out of the scope of the project specifications for PWP. You may have to wait until after graduation to implement such a feature. Something you may want to look into after graduation would be a lightweight CMS like Gatsby or Netlify.
