## Milestone 1
### Feedback
Awesome Job on Milestone1. Your audience purpose and goal are clear and obtainable. You did a great job on defining Your persona. Your persona seemed like a real person. I was able to quickly tell what they were hoping to accomplish using your site. The frustrations/needs illustrated how technology could make her work life easier. The user story was unfortunately incorrect. Instead of focusing on Michelle's overarching goals narrow your thinking to focus more on what Michelle is hoping to accomplish by using your PWP. For example: "As a prospective client, I want to quickly tell if this applicant can meet my social media marketing needs."
